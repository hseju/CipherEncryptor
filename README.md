# CipherEncryptor
This code/Script is written to demonstrate the common useful methods of String class as well as to see how the cipher caesar encryption works
Key varible is used to shift the alphabets around. 
In this example the Key value is 19, hence all alphabets that come after 19th will be detached as a substring and will be shifted to the front of letter A. 
So if the regular aplhabet series is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", the shifted alphabetical order according to caesar cipher method will be "TUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS"
